            <p>
                The Helping Hands Foundation is a non-profit organization, which works with children who are diagnosed
                with cancer. We work on two projects – the Accommodation Project and the Survivor Project. The
                Accommodation Project provides free accommodation to the child and the family during treatment in
                Dharamshalas surrounding the hospital and the Survivor Project works towards regular testing and
                rehabilitation of children who beat cancer. The Helping Hands Foundation is a fund raising entity and
                works in conjunction with Tata Memorial Hospital’s ImPaCCT Foundation.

                Our mission is to provide accommodation to every single child who comes to Mumbai for treatment thereby
                ensuring zero abandonment due to lack of accommodation.
                Our passionate members, teams and partners on ground are
                well-equipped with the knowledge and experience from last year to reach out to those affected and need
                your
